# ha-kodu24

Home Assistant configuration for the house. It began as climate control alone,
which is why most of it is still TRVs, and now also carries the general
housekeeping packages that have nowhere better to live:

- **`trv-climate/` + `danfoss.py`** — pyscript climate sensors for Danfoss
  TRVs (documented below). Heating control itself belongs to Better Thermostat.
- **`battery-monitor/`** — weekly battery nudge, plus immediate alerts for
  safety devices.
- **`backup-monitor/`** — push alerts for the off-site backups running on
  `alpine-docker`. The backup jobs themselves live in the `unraid` repo.
- **`chores/`** — household chore rotation, notifications and dashboard cards
  (see `chores/README.md`). Merged in from the former `ha-chores` repo with
  its history intact.
- **`themes/`** — HA themes; currently the e-ink serif theme the chores
  dashboard is built around.
- **`configuration.yaml`** — HA's root config, tracked here since 2026-09-05.
  Its `packages:` block decides what HA actually loads, so a package directory
  in this repo does nothing until it is listed there.

## Deploying

```sh
./deploy.sh -n         # dry run, shows exactly what would change
./deploy.sh            # rsync + `ha core check`
./deploy.sh --restart  # ...and restart HA
```

Runs over the tailnet (HA is not reachable from the workstation's LAN segment)
and needs the SSH add-on holding this workstation's key. **Edit here, not in
`/config`** — deploys overwrite the live copies.

`curve-test/` is deliberately not deployed: it steps the heating curve down to
find the house's tolerance floor, so it goes live only on a conscious decision.

Dashboards are storage mode, so the YAML under `*/dashboard/` is a record, not
what HA loads — see the dashboard section in `CLAUDE.md` for how to change them
from the shell and keep the record in step.

## Climate

Pyscript-based climate control for Danfoss TRVs in Home Assistant.

### Features

- Reads temperature from Danfoss eTRV0103 climate entities
- Creates virtual room temperature sensors (weighted average when multiple TRVs per room)
- Supports external temperature sensors with configurable weights (label devices with `sensor_weight_X`)
- Updates TRV external temperature sensors from virtual room sensors
- Syncs time on TRVs (weekly)
- Manages radiator covered attribute based on device labels
- Automatic retry queue for failed Zigbee writes (exponential backoff)

## Home Assistant Setup

### Step 1: Copy Files to HA Config

```
config/
├── pyscript/
│   └── danfoss.py                    <- main pyscript
├── trv-climate/
│   └── climate.yaml                  <- template sensors with unique_ids
└── configuration.yaml
```

### Step 2: Include in configuration.yaml

```yaml
homeassistant:
  packages:
    climate_sensors: !include trv-climate/climate.yaml
```

### Step 3: Restart Home Assistant

Settings → System → Restart

## How It Works

### Virtual Temperature Sensors

The pyscript creates virtual sensors (`sensor.climate_{area_id}_temperature`) by:
1. Finding all TRVs assigned to each area
2. Reading `current_temperature` from each TRV's climate entity
3. Calculating weighted average (TRVs have weight 0.5, external sensors use their label weight)
4. Creating virtual sensor entities

The template sensors in `sensors/climate.yaml` wrap these with proper `unique_id` for UI management (area assignment, customization).

### External Temperature Sensors

To add external temperature sensors (e.g., a separate Zigbee sensor):
1. Assign the device to the same area as the TRVs
2. Add a label `sensor_weight_X` where X is the weight (e.g., `sensor_weight_2` for double weight)

### Device Labels

- `radiator_covered` - Sets the TRV's radiator covered attribute (for TRVs behind furniture/curtains)
- `sensor_weight_X` - Includes device's temperature sensor in room average with weight X

### Enable History Graphs for Load Estimates

The TRV load estimate sensors don't have `state_class` set by default, so Home Assistant won't record history. To enable graphs, add to `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
homeassistant:
  customize:
    sensor.trv_danfoss_ada_load_estimate:
      state_class: measurement
    sensor.trv_danfoss_kitchen_load_estimate:
      state_class: measurement
    sensor.trv_danfoss_lola_load_estimate:
      state_class: measurement
    sensor.trv_danfoss_master_load_estimate:
      state_class: measurement
    sensor.trv_danfoss_stairwell_load_estimate:
      state_class: measurement
```

## Scheduled Tasks

| Schedule | Function | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| Startup | `startup` | Runs all init tasks sequentially (avoids Zigbee congestion) |
| Sunday 3:00 AM | `set_time` | Weekly time sync on all TRVs |
| Monday 3:00 AM | `radiator_covered` | Weekly radiator covered attribute check |
| Tuesday 3:00 AM | `disable_load_balancing` | Weekly load balancing disable (for single-TRV rooms) |
| Every 5 min | `update_room_climate_sensors` | Update virtual sensor values |
| Every 5 min | `update_external_temperatures` | Push room temp to TRVs |
| Every 1 min | `process_pending_writes` | Retry failed Zigbee writes |

---

## Zigbee Message Queue

All Zigbee writes go through a retry queue. If a write fails (timeout or error), it's queued for retry with exponential backoff:

| Retry | Delay |
|-------|-------|
| 1 | 1 min |
| 2 | 2 min |
| 3 | 4 min |
| 4 | 8 min |
| 5 | 16 min |
| 6 | 32 min |
| 7 | ~1 hour |
| 8 | ~2 hours |
| 9-10 | 4 hours (max) |

After 10 retries, the write is abandoned and logged as an error.

**Key behaviors:**
- Newer writes for the same device+attribute replace pending ones (stale values discarded)
- Queue is in-memory only (cleared on HA restart)
- Battery-powered TRVs often sleep, causing timeouts—the queue handles this gracefully

**Debug service:** Call `pyscript.get_pending_writes` from Developer Tools → Services to inspect the current queue.

## Adding New Areas

When you add TRVs to a new area:

1. The pyscript will automatically create `sensor.climate_{area_id}_temperature`
2. Add a new entry to `trv-climate/climate.yaml`:

```yaml
      - name: "New Room Temperature"
        unique_id: climate_new_room_temperature
        device_class: temperature
        state_class: measurement
        unit_of_measurement: "°C"
        state: "{{ states('sensor.climate_new_room_temperature') }}"
        availability: "{{ states('sensor.climate_new_room_temperature') not in ['unknown', 'unavailable'] }}"
```

3. Reload YAML or restart Home Assistant

## Battery monitor

`battery-monitor/battery_monitor.yaml` — a weekly Sunday-morning digest of dead and
low batteries, plus an immediate alert when a **leak/smoke sensor** goes offline
(a flat battery on those fails silently: no alert, and no warning that there is no
alert). Copy to `config/battery-monitor/` and include as a package.

Threshold `input_number.battery_warn_level` defaults to **40 %**, higher than the usual
20–25 %, because of the feedback loop below.

**Why batteries and the mesh are one problem:** a thin mesh makes sleepy devices retry
transmissions, retries burn battery, dead devices remove what little routing exists, and
the mesh gets thinner still. **Fresh batteries in a bad mesh drain again** — the routers
are the fix, batteries are symptom relief. Do the ZBMINIR2s first, or at least in the
same visit.

Battery levels are numeric, so HA long-term statistics keep them indefinitely: the
decline slope before vs after the routers go in is directly plottable, which makes this
the instrument for confirming the mesh work actually helped.
